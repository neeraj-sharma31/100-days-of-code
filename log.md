# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Mostly dedicated to CSS)

### Day 1: Jan 01, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started with 'Responsive Web Design' course of FreeCodeCamp and finished 'Basic HTML and HTML5' challenge.

**Thoughts:** Started late night 11pm Jan 1 2022 after just coming from Rathor's house where we have invited for Dinner. I'm about to skip it but its my challenge!
